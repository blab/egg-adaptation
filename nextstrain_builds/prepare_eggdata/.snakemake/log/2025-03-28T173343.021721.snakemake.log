MissingOutputException in rule download_egg_seqs in file /Users/katekistler/nextstrain/egg-adaptation-manuscript/nextstrain_builds/prepare_eggdata/Snakefile, line 14:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
raw_data/h3n2/ha/egg-passaged-sequences.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
