MissingOutputException in rule refine in file /Users/katekistler/nextstrain/all_avian_HAs/nextstrain_builds/Snakefile, line 153:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/H10/tree.nwk
results/H10/branch-lengths.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
